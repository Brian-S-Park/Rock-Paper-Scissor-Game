# Rock Paper Scissors

A classic game of rock paper scissors made in html, css, and js. First player to reach five wins the game! This project came from theodinproject.com as part of the Foundations course. I had a lot of fun learning about animation in css and fine tuning how the game would work. My goal was to make a game that would be responsive and mimic how it felt to play the game in real life. It was a great project to get my feet wet in the subjects. Thank you for checking out my project!
