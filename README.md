Rock Paper Scissors

A classic game of rock paper scissors made in html, css, and js. First player to reach five wins the game! This project came from theodinproject.com as part of the Foundations course. I had a lot of fun learning about animation in css and fine tuning how the game would work. My goal was to make a game that would mimic how it felt to play the game in real life. Thank you for checking out my project!

A live version of my game can be found here: https://brian-s-park.github.io/Rock-Paper-Scissor-Game/
